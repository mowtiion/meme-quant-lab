# Resume checkpoint — 2026-09-24

## Start here after a reset
The Alchemy access/second-source problem is **resolved for the frozen 41-block sample**.
Read `reports/ALCHEMY_PHASE_B_REPORT.md` and its two verification JSON files first.
Do not repeat account setup or rerun the sample merely because conversation context is lost.

## Verified state
- Alchemy Solana Mainnet enabled with user approval; HTTP 403 resolved.
- PR #5 fixes failed request counting; PR #6 adds narrow UI rounding comparison and phase B.
- Run 36025502200 succeeded at code commit acb788c15b45216242946f97aad584a011b7dbfd.
- 41/41 blocks, 43,417 transactions; 19 exact and 22 canonical comparisons.
- Downloaded artifact independently verified offline; 3,258 decoded / 3,082 normalized events
  match, with zero decode and normalization issues. Includes 5 creates and 3 protocol burns.
- Raw evidence artifact ID 10819402938; expires 2026-10-24. Preserve before expiration.
- Artifact SHA-256: bed259be2395aab0deccf1bf31a888b2af22923cc339f242c5c41d37a6c3f6bc.
- No new API calls are needed to repeat the offline verification.

## Resume action
Build an offline, bounded historical pool/reserve and transfer/mint/burn ledger against
this verified sample. See docs/NEXT_STEPS.md. Keep protocol burn separate from wallet demand.
Other gates remain: upstream independence, full historical creation census, binary/IDL mapping,
known-answer parser checks, and bounded planning for 1,000 real launches. EXP-000 remains blocked;
this comparison alone does not authorize or validate bulk downloading or live trading.

## Execution route and limits
GitHub is the durable source of code and reports. The initial scratch checkout may be older
than main; fetch current GitHub files rather than overwriting them with old local versions.
The GitHub connector can fetch run lists through the approved actions/runs endpoint, inspect
jobs, download artifacts and update repository files without browser login.

`.github/workflows/alchemy-phase-b.yml` triggers only manually or when
`configs/alchemy_phase_b_request.json` changes on main. Do not change that request marker
unless another bounded run is actually needed. Normal report/code edits do not call Alchemy.
Limits: 42 calls, 192 MiB, 600 seconds, no retries; each completed slot is checkpointed and
raw evidence is uploaded in <=32 MiB parts for 30 days, even after ordinary script failures.
No paid subscription, wallet signing or trading is enabled.
